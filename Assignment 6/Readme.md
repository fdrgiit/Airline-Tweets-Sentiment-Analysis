#Final Project Report

In this assignment you are required to combine the skills you have developed over the assignment 1 through 5 to answer the questions you set forth to answer in your project problem formulation. Make sure to answer each question explicitly including the technical skills used
utilized and the answers obtained.

Also discuss, which of the original questions could not be identified and why (e.g. lack of data, lack of skills as covered in the current class, ethical issues)? If needed, swap the original questions with a reasonable question that is similar in spirit but answerable with the data and the skillsets available. Finally, also discuss the societal implications (both positive and negative) of the work undertaken.

Make sure to interpret your findings and describe how you will present the findings to the CTO of the company. (Each project will require a 5 minute class presentation to accompany the report.)
