##Define a problem which will benefit from the analysis of tweets

Imagine you are hired as the “Data Science Consultant” for a major business, education, or philanthropic organization. The organization is interested in using new sources of
information relevant to its mission or business objectives and analyze it to provide value to its stakeholders. As your first assignment, you are asked to utilize social media
(Twitter) data to compare the market outreach of two major players in the related area (e.g. Coke and Pepsi, Iphone and Android, Clinton and Trump).
While the details remain for you to figure out (or imagine), but examples of problems of interest include: Checking which one is more popular? How does the popularity change
over time? What percentage of mentions of a particular topic are positive? How does this change over time? What percentage of posts by a particular user are Retweeted?
Who is more popular over the weekend? Who is more popular over the weekends? And so on.

Identify such a problem in a relevant area that interests you. Explain why it is important, what data and what technical skills would be needed? And how you plan to work
towards its completion over the course of the semester. Identify your timeline and milestones. Also, discuss the potential ethical, privacy, or other concerns that may be
relevant to the problem identified.
